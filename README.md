## 🚀 Run Locally

You can open `index.html` directly, but using a local server is recommended for a smoother experience.

Using Node.js (http-server):

1. Install once (if needed):
   npm install -g http-server
2. Start the server from the project folder:
   http-server -p 5500 -c-1
3. Open: http://127.0.0.1:5500

Notes:
- If port 5500 is busy, try 5173 or 8081.
- `-c-1` disables caching for easier development.
